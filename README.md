## Description
The purpose of this streamlit app is to send emails to a given list of people(inviting authors).

During my time as a research assistant for this civil engineering professor at NTUT, he had to send out 
paper invitations to other researchers/professors to contribute to the journal. The number of contactee usually exceeds 100. It used to take his students two or three afternoons to finish this task. 

The only differences between these emails are "receiver_name" and "receiver_discount" in the subject line and in the body of the email. This is a sign for automating...

Once I was aware of this task, i immediately took the initiative to write a email automating app to speed up this highly repetitive process.
