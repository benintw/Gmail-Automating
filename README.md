## Description
The purpose of this streamlit app is to send emails to a list of people given a list of contacts.

During my time as a research assistant for this civil engineering professor at NTUT, he had to send out 
paper invitations to other researchers/professors to contribute to the journal. The number of contactee usually exceeds 100. 

It used to take his students two or three afternoons to finish this task. 

To be more specific, each inviting author has a different "discount" value; some are 50% and some are 800 CHF off. 

Once I was aware of this task, i immediately took the initiative to write a email automating app to speed up the process.
